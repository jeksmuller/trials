            <h1>Lord Is Sufficient For All Of Our Needs</h1>
            <p>Sermon From: Pastor Jacob Delanyo Dotsey</p>
            <p>Theme : Trust in GOD</p>
            <p>On Monday 26 JULY, 2023</p>
            <p>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn
                the world, but to save the world through him.</p>
            <p>Trust in the LORD is necessary for fulfilling any of the wise ways of
                life taught in Proverbs; trusting the Lord is closely connected to
                “fearing” him ( proverbs 1:7)

        <h1>TRUSTING THE LORD </h1>
        <p>Sermon From: Pastor Jacob Delanyo Dotsey</p>
        <p>Theme : Trust Jesus</p>
        <p>On Sunday 2 JULY, 2024</p>
        <p>“The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but
            while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.” (John 5:7)</p>
        <p>When Jesus showed up in our Focal Scripture to show mercy to the man at the pool of Bethesda, the man
            reminded Jesus about how he had no man to put him in the pool. The man knew the system in Bethesda, which
            involved having a man to put him in the pool; but he didn’t even know who Jesus was. He knew more about the
            system of Bethesda than he knew about Jesus Himself. He knew more about systems than about Jesus.
        </p>
        <p> Friend, in 2024, be intentional to know about Jesus more than you know about worldly systems. Fill your mind
            with the knowledge of the glory and power of God. Fill your thoughts with the image of a God who sees you in
            whatever situation you could ever be in. Know more about the power of Jesus than you know about the
            hopelessness of human systems. Know the power of God more than you know men.

            The man at Bethesda had before him, the One who had the power to change his story in split seconds, but his
            thoughts were fixated on what the systems of Bethesda could offer him. He was more interested in what he
            could get from systems of Bethesda than what he could get from Jesus. Never make the mistake of desiring
            more from human systems than you desire from Jesus. Don’t elevate human systems above the power of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>When the system of Bethesda failed the man at the pool, the power of Jesus came through for him. When systems
            failed him, the God who never fails was his sure plug. Instead of keeping your hopes on systems that would
            fail at some point, why don’t you cast your cares on the Jesus who never fails? Why don’t you trust Jesus
            more than you trust economic and health systems? Why not trust Jesus more than you trust systems?

            In 2024, the systems of this world will fail you, sooner or later; but if you keep your eyes on Jesus, He
            won’t fail you. If you keep your gaze on the face of the One who sees you, you will not fall.

            Hebrews 12: 2 says: “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set
            before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”

            Declare With Me: I keep my eyes on Jesus; my hope is not on systems, in Jesus’ name!</p>

            <h1>JOURNEY OF NEGATIVITY</h1>
            <p>Sermon From: Pastor Jacob Delanyo Dotsey</p>
            <p>Theme : No More Negativity</p>
            <p>On Friday 10 AUG, 2024</p>
            <p>F“Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son
                of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.” (Luke 7: 12)</p>

            <p>Our Focal Scripture speaks of how a man was being carried out of the city of Nain, to the place of his
                burial. People were moving, but the end point of the movement was that a young man who should have been
                bubbling with life had just passed on. People were moving, but the end point of the movement was burial.
                People were on the move, but nothing good was to come out of it. It was a journey of negativity.

                Friend, hear me as I hear the Lord: you will not journey in negativity. You will not make movements that
                will take you to a bad place in destiny. You will not make movements that will reduce your destiny. You
                will not make movements that will swallow your life. You will not make movements and make progress that
                will end in negativity. You will not move from life to death. You will not make movements that will cut
                you down.

                People were on the move, but nothing good was going to come out of their movement. People were on the
                move, but they were to end in the place of death. People appeared to be making progress, but that
                progress was going to lead them to the grave. Hear me as I hear the Lord: it will never be said that
                your progress ended in the grave. It will never be said that you were swallowed in your own progress.
                You will not journey to death.
